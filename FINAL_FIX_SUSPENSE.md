# 🔧 FINAL FIX APPLIED - Suspense Boundary Added

## What Was Just Changed

### Issue: Next.js `useSearchParams` Error in Layout
The `useSignInRedirect` hook uses `useSearchParams()`, which requires a Suspense boundary when used in layouts (this is a Next.js requirement).

### Solution Applied ✅
1. **Wrapped layout with `<Suspense>` boundary**
2. **Removed problematic `useSignInRedirect` from main layout**
3. **Added proper loading fallback**

## Files Modified
- ✅ `src/app/(dashboard)/layout.tsx` - **CRITICAL FIX**
- ✅ Backup created: `layout_backup.tsx`

---

## 🧪 TESTING INSTRUCTIONS

### Step 1: Clear Everything
```bash
# Hard refresh browser
Ctrl + Shift + R (Windows)
Cmd + Shift + R (Mac)

# Or clear cache
Ctrl + Shift + Delete → Clear cached files
```

### Step 2: Test Basic Rendering
Navigate to these pages **in order**:

1. **`/tenants/test`** ← Start here!
   - Should show green "Success!" message
   - If this loads → Layout is working
   - If white screen → Check console (F12)

2. **`/tenants/system-check`**
   - Shows authentication status
   - Displays your user info
   - All checks should be green ✅

3. **`/tenants/dashboard`**
   - Your main dashboard
   - Should load all cards and data

4. **`/tenants/favorites`**
   - Saved properties
   - Should show your favorites

### Step 3: Check Browser Console
**Press F12 → Console Tab**

Look for:
- ✅ Green success messages
- ❌ Red error messages (share these!)

## 🚨 If Still Seeing White Screen

### Scenario A: `/tenants/test` Loads Fine
**Problem**: Data fetching or API issue
**Solution**: Check network tab (F12 → Network) for failed requests

### Scenario B: `/tenants/test` is White Screen
**Problem**: Layout or authentication issue
**Check Console For:**
- `useSearchParams` error → Should be fixed now
- `Authentication required` → Need to sign in
- Other errors → Share the exact message

### Scenario C: Everything is White
**Problem**: Possible build or cache issue
**Try:**
1. Stop dev server (Ctrl + C)
2. Delete `.next` folder
3. Run `bun run dev` again
4. Hard refresh browser
