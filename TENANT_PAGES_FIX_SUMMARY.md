# Tenant Dashboard Pages - Fix Summary

## Problem
All tenant dashboard pages were showing white screens due to unhandled errors during rendering.

## Solution Applied

### 1. Created ErrorBoundary Component
- **File**: `src/components/ErrorBoundary.tsx`
- **Purpose**: Catch and display rendering errors gracefully instead of showing white screen
- **Features**:
  - Catches all React component errors
  - Shows user-friendly error message
  - Provides refresh button
  - Displays error details in collapsible section for debugging

### 2. Fixed All Tenant Pages

All pages now include:
- ✅ Error boundary wrapper
- ✅ Try-catch blocks around map operations
- ✅ Safe data normalization
- ✅ Proper null/undefined checks
- ✅ Graceful error handling

#### Pages Fixed:

1. **Favorites Page** (`tenants/favorites/page.tsx`)
   - Added ErrorBoundary wrapper
   - Added try-catch in property rendering loop
   - Safe property data transformation
   - Better error messages for failed card renders

2. **Residences Page** (`tenants/residences/page.tsx`)
   - Completely recreated with ErrorBoundary
   - Added try-catch in residence rendering
   - Safe normalization function with fallbacks
   - Better loading states

3. **Dashboard Page** (`tenants/dashboard/page.tsx`)
   - Added ErrorBoundary wrapper
   - Try-catch blocks for all property/residence maps
   - Safe error handling in favorite toggle

4. **Applications Page** (`tenants/applications/page.tsx`)
   - Completely recreated from scratch
   - Added ErrorBoundary wrapper
   - Try-catch in application rendering loop
   - Proper error display for failed renders

5. **Settings Page** (`tenants/settings/page.tsx`)
   - Added ErrorBoundary wrapper
   - Try-catch in form submission
   - Better error logging

### 3. Authentication Compatibility

All pages work with your existing authentication system:
- ✅ Compatible with NextAuth (Google)
- ✅ Compatible with AWS Cognito
- ✅ Uses `useUnifiedAuth` hook correctly
- ✅ Proper role checking (tenant/student vs manager)

### 4. What Changed

**Before**: 
- Pages crashed silently showing white screen
- No error boundaries
- Unhandled exceptions in map operations
- No fallbacks for missing data

**After**:
- Errors are caught and displayed properly
- User sees helpful error messages
- Option to refresh or get support
- Development error details available
- Individual card errors don't crash entire page

### 5. Testing Checklist

Please test the following pages:
- [ ] `/tenants/favorites` - Should load without white screen
- [ ] `/tenants/residences` - Should load without white screen
- [ ] `/tenants/dashboard` - Should load without white screen
- [ ] `/tenants/applications` - Should load without white screen
- [ ] `/tenants/settings` - Should load without white screen

### 6. How to Debug Further

If you still see issues:

1. **Check Browser Console**
   ```
   Press F12 → Console tab
   Look for red error messages
   ```

2. **Check Network Tab**
   ```
   Press F12 → Network tab
   Look for failed API calls (red status)
   ```

3. **Check Error Boundary**
   - If you see the error boundary screen, click "Error details"
   - This will show the exact error that occurred
   - Share this error message for further debugging

### 7. Common Issues and Solutions

**Issue**: Still seeing white screen
- **Solution**: Hard refresh (Ctrl+Shift+R) to clear cache

**Issue**: "Unable to display property/residence" messages
- **Solution**: Check API responses - data might be missing required fields

**Issue**: Authentication errors
- **Solution**: Sign out and sign in again to refresh auth token

### 8. Future Improvements

Consider adding:
- Loading skeletons for better UX
- Retry buttons on failed data fetches
- Toast notifications for errors
- Sentry or similar error tracking
