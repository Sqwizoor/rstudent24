# üö® CRITICAL WHITE SCREEN FIX APPLIED

## Root Cause Identified
The white screen was caused by **dual auth system conflict**:
- App supports both **NextAuth (Google)** and **AWS Cognito** authentication
- The `useUnifiedAuth` hook was calling BOTH auth APIs simultaneously
- When signed in via Google, the Cognito API call would fail, causing errors
- These errors weren't being caught, resulting in white screens

## What Was Fixed

### 1. **useUnifiedAuth Hook** (`src/hooks/useUnifiedAuth.ts`)
- ‚úÖ Added `skip: true` to Cognito query when NextAuth is already active
- ‚úÖ Added debug logging to track auth state
- ‚úÖ Prevents unnecessary API calls that cause failures

### 2. **Dashboard Layout** (`src/app/(dashboard)/layout.tsx`)
- ‚úÖ Added comprehensive debug logging
- ‚úÖ Maintained Suspense boundary for useSearchParams safety
- ‚úÖ Proper loading states and error handling

### 3. **Test Pages Created**
- ‚úÖ `/tenants/minimal-test` - Zero-dependency render test
- ‚úÖ `/tenants/test` - Basic auth test
- ‚úÖ `/tenants/system-check` - Full auth diagnostics
- ‚úÖ `/tenants/debug-favorites` - Favorites-specific debugging

## How to Test

### Step 1: Restart Dev Server
```bash
# Stop the server (Ctrl+C)
# Clear cache and restart
rm -rf .next
bun run dev
```

### Step 2: Open Browser Console (F12)
Look for these debug messages:
- `üîê useUnifiedAuth state:` - Shows which auth system is active
- `üîç Dashboard Layout Auth Debug:` - Shows user object and loading state

### Step 3: Test These URLs
1. **http://localhost:3000/tenants/minimal-test** - Should show green page (bypasses auth)
2. **http://localhost:3000/tenants/test** - Should show "Test page loaded"
3. **http://localhost:3000/tenants/system-check** - Should show your auth details
4. **http://localhost:3000/tenants/favorites** - Should now work!

### Step 4: Check Console for Errors
If you still see white screen, press F12 and look for:
- ‚ùå Red error messages
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Yellow warnings
- üîê Auth debug logs (should show your user data)

## Your Authentication Setup

**You do NOT have Kinde installed.** Your app uses:
1. **NextAuth** - For Google sign-in (tenants/students)
2. **AWS Cognito** - For manager/landlord sign-in

To sign in as a tenant:
- Use: `http://localhost:3000/signin` (Google button)

To sign in as a manager:
- Use: `http://localhost:3000/cognito-signin` (Cognito)

## If Still Not Working

### Check #1: Which Sign-In Did You Use?
```
If you signed in via Google ‚Üí You're using NextAuth
If you signed in via email/password form ‚Üí You're using Cognito
```

### Check #2: Check Your Console Logs
Look for the debug message:
```
üîê useUnifiedAuth state: {
  nextAuthStatus: "authenticated",  // Should be "authenticated" if signed in
  hasNextAuthSession: true,         // Should be true if Google sign-in worked
  skipCognito: true                 // Should be true if NextAuth is active
}
```

### Check #3: Check Network Tab (F12 ‚Üí Network)
- Should NOT see failed API calls to `/api/auth-user` (Cognito endpoint)
- Should only see NextAuth session calls if you signed in with Google

## Install Kinde (If That's What You Actually Want)

If you want to replace the current auth system with Kinde:

```bash
# Install Kinde SDK
bun add @kinde-oss/kinde-auth-nextjs

# Follow setup: https://kinde.com/docs/developer-tools/nextjs-sdk/
```

Then I can help migrate from NextAuth+Cognito ‚Üí Kinde.

## Contact Debug Info

If still stuck, share:
1. Screenshot of browser console (F12 ‚Üí Console tab)
2. Screenshot of Network tab showing failed requests
3. Which URL you used to sign in
4. Output of debug messages in console
