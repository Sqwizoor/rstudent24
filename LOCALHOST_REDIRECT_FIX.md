# 🔧 LOCALHOST REDIRECT FIX

## Problem
When signing in on localhost, you were being redirected to the production website (https://rstudent24.vercel.app).

## Root Cause
The `.env` file had `NEXTAUTH_URL=https://rstudent24.vercel.app`, which NextAuth uses for all redirects.

## Solution Applied

### 1. Created `.env.local` for Development
- ✅ `NEXTAUTH_URL=http://localhost:3000` (for local development)
- ✅ Contains all environment variables
- ✅ Git-ignored (never committed to repository)
- ✅ **Takes priority over `.env` when running locally**

### 2. Updated `.env` for Production
- ✅ `NEXTAUTH_URL=https://rstudent24.vercel.app` (for Vercel production)
- ✅ Vercel will use this file when deployed
- ✅ Local development will ignore this and use `.env.local` instead

## How Environment Files Work

```
Priority Order:
1. .env.local       ← Highest priority (used in development)
2. .env             ← Used as fallback (used in production by Vercel)
```

## Next Steps

### 1. **Restart Your Dev Server** (REQUIRED!)
```bash
# Press Ctrl+C to stop the current server
# Then restart:
bun run dev
```

Environment variables are only loaded at server startup, so you MUST restart!

### 2. **Test the Fix**
1. Go to: `http://localhost:3000/signin`
2. Click "Sign in with Google"
3. After Google authentication, you should stay on `localhost:3000`
4. You should be redirected to `http://localhost:3000/tenants/dashboard` (NOT to vercel.app)

### 3. **Clear Browser Cookies** (If Still Redirecting)
If you're still being redirected to production:
1. Open browser DevTools (F12)
2. Go to Application tab → Storage → Clear site data
3. Or use Incognito/Private browsing mode
4. Try signing in again

## Verification Checklist

After restarting the server, check:
- [ ] Server console shows: `Local: http://localhost:3000`
- [ ] No errors about NEXTAUTH_URL
- [ ] Signing in with Google stays on localhost
- [ ] After auth, you see tenant dashboard on localhost
- [ ] Console logs show: `🔍 Dashboard Layout Auth Debug:` with your user data

## Files Changed

### `.env.local` (NEW - for local development)
```env
NEXTAUTH_URL=http://localhost:3000
# ... all other environment variables
```

### `.env` (UPDATED - for production)
```env
NEXTAUTH_URL=https://rstudent24.vercel.app
# ... all other environment variables
```

## Production Deployment Notes

When you deploy to Vercel:
- ✅ Vercel will use `.env` file (production URL)
- ✅ `.env.local` is never deployed (git-ignored)
- ✅ No changes needed in Vercel settings
- ✅ Production auth will work correctly

## Troubleshooting

### Still Redirecting to Production?
1. **Did you restart the dev server?** (Most common issue!)
   ```bash
   Ctrl+C
   bun run dev
   ```

2. **Check which env file is loaded:**
   Add this to `next.config.js` temporarily:
   ```js
   console.log('NEXTAUTH_URL:', process.env.NEXTAUTH_URL);
   ```
   Should show: `http://localhost:3000`

3. **Clear browser cache:**
   - Chrome: Ctrl+Shift+Delete → Clear cached images and files
   - Or use Incognito mode

4. **Check for old sessions:**
   ```bash
   # Delete .next cache
   rm -rf .next
   bun run dev
   ```

### Environment Variable Not Loading?
Make sure `.env.local` is in the root directory:
```
client/
  ├── .env          ← Production defaults
  ├── .env.local    ← Local development (THIS ONE!)
  ├── src/
  ├── prisma/
  └── package.json
```

## Additional Auth Debug

Add this to your browser console after signing in:
```javascript
// Check current session
fetch('/api/auth/session').then(r => r.json()).then(console.log);
```

Should show your user object with role: "tenant"

**Fix Applied**: Local development now uses localhost, production uses vercel.app
